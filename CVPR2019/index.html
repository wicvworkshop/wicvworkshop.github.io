                <p style="margin: 0px 0px 20px 10px;">
                Computer vision has become one of the largest computer science research communities. We have made tremendous progress in recent years over a wide range of areas, including object recognition, image understanding, video analysis, 3D reconstruction, etc.
                </p>
                <p style="margin: 0px 0px 20px 10px;">However, despite the expansion of our field, the percentage of female faculty members and researchers both in academia and in industry is still relatively low. As a result, many female researchers working in computer vision may feel isolated and do not have a lot of opportunities to meet with other women.
                </p>
                <p style="margin: 0px 0px 20px 10px;"> The goals of this workshop are to:<br>
                <li style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 40px;text-align:left;"> Raise visibility of female computer vision researchers by presenting invited research talks by women who are role models in this field.</li> 
                <li style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 40px;text-align:left;"> Give opportunities to junior female students or researchers to present their work via a poster session and travel awards. </li>
                <li style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 40px;text-align:left;"> Share experience and career advice for female students and professionals.</li>
                </p>
                <p style="margin: 0px 0px 20px 10px;">The half-day workshop on Women in Computer Vision is a gathering for <u>both women and men</u> working in computer vision. Researchers at all levels who are interested in computer vision are welcome and encouraged to attend the workshop. Travel grants will be offered to selected female presenters of oral and poster sessions.
                </p>
