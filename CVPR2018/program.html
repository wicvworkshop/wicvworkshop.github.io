                   <b>Title:</b> Dynamics-based Invariants for Video Understanding
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Abstract:</b> The power of geometric invariants to provide solutions to computer vision problems has been recognized for a long time. On the other hand, dynamics-based invariants are often overlooked. Yet, visual data come in streams: videos are temporal sequences of frames, images are ordered sequences of rows of pixels and contours are chained sequences of edges. In this talk, I will discuss the key role that systems theory can play in timely extracting and exploiting dynamics-based invariants to capture actionable information that is very sparsely encoded in high dimensional data streams. The central theme of this approach is the use of dynamical models, and their associated invariants, as an information-encoding paradigm. We will show that embedding problems in the conceptual world of dynamical systems makes available a rich, extremely powerful resource base, leading to robust solutions, or, in cases where the underlying problem is intrinsically hard, to computationally tractable approximations with sub optimality certificates.  We will illustrate these ideas in the context of several practical applications: crowd-sourcing video, activity recognition, human re-identification and video prediction.

                   <b>Title:</b> CNN vs SIFT-based localization: out with the old?
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Abstract:</b> Recently Deep Learning has achieved such a great performance in so many vision tasks that researcher are starting to use it to solve any imaginable task, disregarding previous methods optimised over decades of research work.
Image-based localization is one of those problems: a classic task in Computer Vision where given an image, we are asked to find its camera pose and orientation with respect to a given model which can have a scale ranging from a city to a small room.
Recently researchers have turned into CNNs for pose estimation disregarding previous literature and even disregarding basic epipolar geometry.
In our first work, we put both methods to test: on the one hand, we clearly show CNN-based localization has still an incredibly long way to go with respect to SIFT-based methods; on the other hand, we present an indoor dataset in which classic methods suffer due to textureless surfaces and repetitive structures.
Afterwards, I will also present our first attempt towards a fully scalable method based on relative pose estimation that allows us to localize a camera in any given scene with a single network (and even use epipolar geometry!).
I will show that a marriage between CNN and Computer Vision classic knowledge is still possible and very much desirable in today's research landscape.

 <b>Title:</b> When bias in AI and product design means life or death.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Abstract:</b> Description: A talk about bias in AI products could impact humanity - the state of where we are and the largest pitfalls all throughout the process. Will go through a history of AI products and discuss where bias creeps in and how to create a safer, more delightful products for the world. Since we're at the start of the AI revolution, this lays groundwork for how to be thoughtful as a company and as a consumer.

                    <b>Title:</b> Learning to Segment Moving Objects
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Abstract:</b> This talk addresses the task of segmenting moving objects in unconstrained videos. We introduce a novel two-stream neural network with an explicit memory module to achieve this. The two streams of the network encode spatial and temporal features in a video sequence respectively, while the memory module captures the evolution of objects over time. The module to build a “visual memory” in video, i.e., a joint representation of all the video frames, is realized with a convolutional recurrent unit learned from a small number of training video sequences. Given video frames as input, our approach first assigns each pixel an object or background label obtained with an encoder-decoder network that takes as input optical flow and is trained on synthetic data. Next, a “visual memory” specific to the video is acquired automatically without any manually-annotated frames. The visual memory is implemented with convolutional gated recurrent units, which allows to propagate spatial information over time. We evaluate our method extensively on two benchmarks, DAVIS and Freiburg-Berkeley motion segmentation datasets, and show state-of-the-art results.

                    <b>Abstract:</b> State-of-the-art semantic segmentation approaches increase the receptive field of their models by using either a downsampling path composed of poolings/strided convolutions or successive dilated convolutions. However, it is not clear which operation leads to best results. In this paper, we systematically study the differences introduced by distinct receptive field enlargement methods and their impact on the performance of a novel architecture, called Fully Convolutional DenseResNet (FC-DRN). FC-DRN has a densely connected backbone composed of residual networks. Following standard image segmentation architectures, receptive field enlargement operations that change the representation level are interleaved among residual networks. This allows the model to exploit the benefits of both residual and dense connectivity patterns, namely: gradient flow, iterative refinement of representations, multi-scale feature combination and deep supervision. In order to highlight the potential of our model, we test it on the challenging CamVid urban scene understanding benchmark and make the following observations: 1) downsampling operations outperform dilations when the model is trained from scratch, 2) dilations are useful during the finetuning step of the model, 3) coarser representations require less refinement steps, and 4) ResNets (by model construction) are good regularizers, since they can reduce the model capacity when needed. Finally, we compare our architecture to alternative methods and report state-of-the-art result on the Camvid dataset, with at least twice fewer parameters.

                    <b>Abstract:</b> Dense video captioning is a fine-grained video understanding task that involves two sub-problems: localizing distinct events in a long video stream, and generating captions for the localized events. We propose the Joint Event Detection and Description Network (JEDDi-Net), which solves the dense video captioning task in an end-to-end fashion. Our model continuously encodes the input video stream with three-dimensional convolutional layers, proposes variable-length temporal events based on pooled features, and generates their captions. Unlike existing approaches, our event proposal generation and language captioning networks are trained jointly and end-to-end, allowing for improved temporal segmentation. In order to explicitly model temporal relationships between visual events and their captions in a single video, we also propose a two-level hierarchical captioning module that keeps track of context. On the large-scale ActivityNet Captions dataset, JEDDi-Net demonstrates improved results as measured by standard metrics. We also present the first dense captioning results on the TACoS-MultiLevel dataset.

                    <b>Abstract:</b> Many structured prediction tasks arising in computer vision and natural language processing tractably reduce to making minimum cost cuts in graphs with edge weights learned us-
ing maximum margin methods. Unfortunately, the hinge loss used to construct these methods often provides a particularly
loose bound on the loss function of interest (e.g., the Hamming loss). We develop Adversarial Robust Cuts (ARC), an approach  that  poses  the  learning  task  as  a  minimax  game between predictor and “label approximator” based on minimum  cost  graph  cuts.  Unlike  maximum  margin  methods, this game-theoretic perspective always provides meaningful bounds  on  the  Hamming  loss.  We  conduct  multi-label  and semi-supervised binary prediction experiments that demonstrate the benefits of our approach.

                    <b>Abstract:</b> We propose and investigate an identity sensitive joint embedding of face and voice. Such an embedding enables cross-modal retrieval from voice to face and from face to voice. We make the following four contributions: first, we show that the embedding can be learnt from videos of talking faces, without requiring any identity labels, using a form of cross-modal self-supervision; second, we develop a curriculum learning schedule for hard negative mining targeted to this task, that is essential for learning to proceed successfully; third, we demonstrate and evaluate cross-modal retrieval for identities unseen and unheard during training over a number of scenarios and establish a benchmark for this novel task; finally, we show an application of using the joint embedding for automatically retrieving and labelling characters in TV dramas.

                    <b>Abstract:</b> We develop a method for policy architecture search and adaptation via gradient-free optimization which can learn to perform autonomous driving tasks. By learning from both demonstration and environmental reward we develop a model that can learn with relatively few early catastrophic failures. We first learn an architecture of appropriate complexity to perceive aspects of world state relevant to the expert demonstration, and then mitigate the effect of domain-shift during deployment by adapting a policy demonstrated in a source domain to rewards obtained in a target environment. We show that our approach allows safer learning than baseline methods, offering a reduced cumulative crash metric over the agent's lifetime as it learns to drive in a realistic simulated environment.

                    <b>Abstract:</b> A number of studies have found that today's Visual Question Answering (VQA) models are heavily driven by superficial correlations in the training data and lack sufficient image grounding. To encourage development of models geared towards the latter, we propose a new setting for VQA where for every question type, train and test sets have different prior distributions of answers. Specifically, we present new splits of the VQA v1 and VQA v2 datasets, which we call Visual Question Answering under Changing Priors (VQA-CP v1 and VQA-CP v2 respectively). First, we evaluate several existing VQA models under this new setting and show that their performance degrades significantly compared to the original VQA setting. Second, we propose a novel Grounded Visual Question Answering model (GVQA) that contains inductive biases and restrictions in the architecture specifically designed to prevent the model from 'cheating' by primarily relying on priors in the training data. Specifically, GVQA explicitly disentangles the recognition of visual concepts present in the image from the identification of plausible answer space for a given question, enabling the model to more robustly generalize across different distributions of answers. GVQA is built off an existing VQA model -- Stacked Attention Networks (SAN). Our experiments demonstrate that GVQA significantly outperforms SAN on both VQA-CP v1 and VQA-CP v2 datasets. Interestingly, it also outperforms more powerful VQA models such as Multimodal Compact Bilinear Pooling (MCB) in several cases. GVQA offers strengths complementary to SAN when trained and evaluated on the original VQA v1 and VQA v2 datasets. Finally, GVQA is more transparent and interpretable than existing VQA models.
